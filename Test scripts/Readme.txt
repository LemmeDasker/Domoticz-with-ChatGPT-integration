Here you have test scripts so you can test the major functions before you start with the main code.

If you can have each of these individual scripts working, you will know that the settings are correct, and you will not have to trouble shoot on the main code.
The file 'hey_computer.table' are used by 'wakeword.py'.
As an alternative, you can use the 'Alexa' wake word in 'alexa.table'.
